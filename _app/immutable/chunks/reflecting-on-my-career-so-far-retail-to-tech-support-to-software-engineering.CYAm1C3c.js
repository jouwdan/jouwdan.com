But let’s take a step back to the beginning.",R,d,de="The dreaded Retail job",W,u,ue="After graduating, while I applied to any tech jobs I could find, I worked in Retail as a Sales Assistant. I hated it. Stacking shelves, folding clothes, unpacking boxes… it felt mindless, it bored me. I wanted a challenge, something to keep my mind active. Reflecting on it though, this experience ended up being a huge help in my tech career, giving me vital ‘people skills’.",O,m,me="My first job in tech",z,f,fe="Fast forward a few months and my contract was ending, I was travelling (literally getting on the plane to go!) to the UK to visit family, and I got a call from what would be my future manager. He offered me a “Junior IT Administrator” role. It was a 2.5 hour journey each way, the pay was - let’s be frank - awful, but it was a start. A job in IT. Something i’d only dreamed of as a student. I was excited - ecstatic - that I was going to work in tech. I hastily accepted and couldn’t wait to get back to start!",E,w,we="This role was a very generalist role. I would build & upgrade Windows machines - during the vital rollout of Windows 10 during the time Windows 7 was going EOL, do onsite user support for the office, manage a service desk of tasks, set up new equipment & run new start inductions… But more importantly, I learned how businesses heavily rely on technology, I learned the best practises for implementing and managing technology in a business, I learned how to communicate with stakeholders. My mind was active, I was kept busy, I loved every minute of the job. But the travel taken it’s toll. Taking trains for 5 hours a day over a 2 year period had me burned out and tired. Moving to the city wasn’t an option, so I went on the job hunt for closer to home roles.",F,p,pe="Cheese, glorious cheese",V,c,ce="I spotted an ad for an interesting role. I didn’t meet the job spec, but it was something I was ready for. A new cheese factory was to be built 20 minutes from my home. They were looking for an “IT Support Officer”. But it was more than that. They needed boots on the ground to implement the IT infrastructure during the build & commissioning… and do tech support. It was a big shift, I would be the sole person on the site. But I was excited about it. So, after applying, I was invited to interview. One evening I met with the HR & IT managers - out of office hours - and they believed in me. My enthusiasm for technology and to learn.",U,g,ge="I had to learn, and fast. I was blessed to have a great mentor in this job, the IT manager who interviewed me and believed in me. There was also a vast network of extremely knowledgeable people in the parent company to soak up information from - Project managers, network architects, system admins… I was like a sponge. I soaked up everything I could in order to get the job done the best I could, and gain the knowledge I needed to kick start my career.",G,y,ye="COVID… A blessing and a curse",J,v,ve="And then COVID came. Construction came to a halt. Everyone had to work remotely. Luckily, I had already implemented everything required for the team to work effectively from home with little productivity loss.

Spending time with my fiancé (now wife). I loved being there and being able work from home. We live in a rural area, so even the COVID restrictions didn’t make much of a difference. The business had some old PHP CRUD databases they wanted me to look at, built by a predecessor. I told them I always had an interest in web design, I had made a few websites for local businesses with WordPress, but no professional experience. I had to redesign them and implement new features.

I had no idea…",K,b,be="Springboard to the rescue",N,x,xe="I took to the internet. Searching for courses, bootcamps and everything inbetween. Then I stumbled upon a post on an Irish forum site about Springboard. To get you up to speed quickly, Springboard is an Irish government initiative which subsidises qualifications in the technology sector. They would pay 90% of my course fees if I went back to study. I scoured their website for days, searching for the right course for me. That’s when I came across it, the HDip in Computer Science at SETU Waterford.

I applied, interviewed, and was accepted.",Y,C,Ce="Summer… Learning?",Q,k,ke="6 months later, semester 1 was over. It was summer, I was hungry to keep learning, and I had an idea. I reached out to my lecturers, who had developed the software used to deliver the course remotely. It was open source, I didn’t like the design of it, and I offered to implement a new design system. I’d never worked with a full stack application to this scale before, but I was ready and willing to learn. After some back and forth, we settled on a design system and I got to work. After many evenings breaking things and putting them back together, silly questions and googling, I got there. I put in a pull request with the new design, and it went live. And I got positive feedback from my classmates. I had made a difference.",X,_,_e="A brightly coloured Fedora",Z,j,je="At this point, I was proud of the work i’d put in.

My mentor left the business for greener pastures, along with a huge overturn of staff - from senior leadership down to production operatives - and the role felt more and more mundane. The goal was reached, my hard work had paid off and the infrastructure was implemented. But now I was just doing day to day maintenance and tech support. My mind wasn’t kept active, and I had a new goal. I was still learning in my own time, putting time into Tutors, I wanted to branch out into Software Engineering, build things that made a difference.
